--- FUNCTION ---
For each guess in Co-ordle, this part of the bot will analyze its...
1. SKILL - a score from 0-100 which is determined primarily by how much of the "solution space"
   that guess eliminates ON AVERAGE
2. LUCK - a designation of 'GOOD', 'AVERAGE', or 'BAD', determined by how much of the "solution space"
   that guess ACTUALLY eliminated, given the answer to the Co-ordle
        (For example, 'COCCYX' would usually return a low SKILL score, which is intuitive since it contains 
        some pretty uncommon letter combinations. However, if the answer to that Co-ordle just happens to be 
        'COCCYX', the LUCK would evaluate to 'GOOD' - i.e. "this guess is not very strategic, but in this 
        particular case, we got lucky.)
3. TOP 5 ALTERNATIVE GUESSES - what the bot determines as the best guesses at this step

Additionally, the program can generate a full pattern between list of allowed guesses and a "solution wordlist",
which is saved as a file for quicker reference.
    This solution wordlist is a combination of a list of the ~5000 most common 6-letter words according
    to Wiktionary, and a list of seen Co-ordle solutions put together from thousands of plays.

--- CREDIT ---
- The math behind all the pattern determination & generation and  entropy calculations uses original work by 
  3Blue1Brown (see readme for source), under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 License. Modifications to original code include:
    - updated ternary representation of pattern with np.int64 (was np.uint8)
        - handles larger integers for 6-letter version of Wordle
    - modified code which was hardcoded to 5 letters to LENGTH letters (global const)
    - set word length as global constant (6) instead of determining length from first word of list
    - renamed functions/variables for clarity and preference
        - words_to_int_arrays -> wordsToInts
        - generate_pattern_matrix -> generatePatterns
        - pattern_to_int_list -> intToPattern
        - etc.
- The list of the ~5000 most common 6-letter words according to Wiktionary was put together and kindly shared 
  with me by another Co-ordle enthusiast. 

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- Currently, the ?eval function can only be called as a reply to the Co-ordle you wish to analyze
  I hope to update it so that if called on its own, it simply analyzes the last completed Co-ordle
